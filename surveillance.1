.SH DESCRIPTION
.B surveillance
is a native GTK4 desktop client for Synology Surveillance Station.
It connects to a Synology NAS via its REST API to provide live camera views,
recording playback, PTZ control, snapshots, events/alerts, and home mode management.
.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B Live View
View live camera streams in configurable grid layouts (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4).
Each layout remembers its own camera arrangement independently.
Video is rendered via mpv with hardware acceleration.
.TP
.B Recording Playback
Browse, play back, and download recordings filtered by camera and date. Camera snapshot thumbnails are shown for each recording.
.TP
.B PTZ Control
Control pan-tilt-zoom cameras with direction pad, zoom, preset positions, and patrol routes.
.TP
.B Snapshots
Take live snapshots, browse saved snapshots, download and delete.
.TP
.B Events & Alerts
View motion detection events and camera alerts with notification popover and badges.
.TP
.B Home Mode
Toggle Surveillance Station home mode from the header bar.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration is stored in TOML format at:

.I ~/.config/surveillance-station/config.toml
.PP
Connection profiles define NAS host, port, HTTPS, and SSL verification settings.
Credentials are stored securely via the system keyring.

The
.B [session]
section stores the grid layout, active page, and camera assignments.
It is updated automatically so the application restores the previous viewing
session on restart.
.PP
The
.B [camera_protocols]
section selects the stream protocol per camera (auto, rtsp, rtsp_over_http,
mjpeg, multicast, direct).  When set to

These settings can be configured by right-clicking a camera in the sidebar.
