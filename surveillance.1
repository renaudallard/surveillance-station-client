.SH SYNOPSIS
.B surveillance
.RB [ \-\-debug ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B surveillance
is a native GTK4 desktop client for Synology Surveillance Station.
It connects to a Synology NAS via its REST API to provide live camera views,
recording playback, PTZ control, snapshots, events/alerts, and home mode management.
.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B Live View
View live camera streams in configurable grid layouts (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4).
Each layout remembers its own camera arrangement independently.
Video is rendered via mpv with hardware acceleration.
.TP
.B Recording Playback
Browse, play back, and download recordings filtered by camera and date.
Search recordings by camera(s) and time range with preset filters (today, last 7 days, last 30 days).
Per-event thumbnails are shown for each recording.
.TP
.B PTZ Control
Control pan-tilt-zoom cameras with direction pad, zoom, preset positions, and patrol routes. Controls appear automatically below the live view when a PTZ-capable camera is active.
.TP
.B Snapshots
Take live snapshots, browse saved snapshots, download and delete.
.TP
.B Time Lapse
Browse, play back, download, and manage Smart Time Lapse recordings.
.TP

.SH OPTIONS
.TP

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration is stored in TOML format at:
.PP
.I ~/.config/surveillance-station/config.toml
.PP
Connection profiles define NAS host, port, HTTPS, and SSL verification settings.
Credentials are stored securely via the system keyring.
.PP
The
.B [session]
section stores the grid layout, active page, and camera assignments.
It is updated automatically so the application restores the previous viewing
session on restart.
.PP
The
.B [camera_protocols]
section selects the stream protocol per camera (auto, rtsp, rtsp_over_http,
mjpeg, multicast, webapi, websocket, direct).
.IR webapi
uses the Synology HTTP stream endpoint.
.IR websocket
uses a WebSocket stream bridged to mpv via a named pipe.
When set to
.IR direct ,
the URL from
.B [camera_overrides]
is used instead of Synology's RTSP proxy.
These settings can be configured by right-clicking a camera in the sidebar.
